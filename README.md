Instructions for development
----------------------------

0. Make sure you have [docker](https://docker.io) and [docker-compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)
1. make up
2. make fixtures

The main web service is available at localhost:8000/api/aggregates/ and it accepts
2 query parameters:
 - measurements: list
 - dimensions: list
 Every other query parameter matching one of the dimension names will be considered as a filter over that dimension. The only types of filter supported are exact match and range comparison. Single-valued query parameters are interpreted as  exact matches, while multi-value parameters are interpreted as range comparison. In the example below, `country` is an exact match, while `version` is a range comparison.

 Example query string: [dimensions=os_name&dimensions=os_version&dimensions=country&measurements=main_crashes&country=GB](http://localhost:8000/api/aggregates/?dimensions=os_name&dimensions=os_version&dimensions=country&measurements=main_crashes&country=GB&version=53&version=57)
